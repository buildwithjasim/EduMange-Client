## 📘 Description

EduManage is a full-featured education management system designed to streamline operations for students, teachers, and administrators through a modern, scalable MERN stack application.

The platform includes secure multi-role authentication, dynamic dashboards, class and assignment management, and an integrated payment system using Stripe. Teachers can submit classes and assignments, while students can enroll, submit work, and rate instructors. Admins oversee approvals and system-wide data visibility.

The UI is fully responsive and user-friendly, ensuring optimal experience across all devices. Backend APIs are secured with JWT, and the system includes real-time reporting features such as student feedback, enrollment data, and submission analytics.

This project demonstrates my full-stack skills across authentication, route protection, API design, database structure, real-time UI updates, and third-party integrations (Stripe, Firebase).
